## Online Method
 
The online method involves using a tool called KMS Activator that will connect to a Key Management Service (KMS) server and activate your Windows 8 Build 8400. This method requires an internet connection and may not work if the KMS server is down or blocked by your firewall or antivirus. Here are the steps to follow:
 
1. Download the KMS Activator from [here](https://opensea.io/collection/windows-8-build-8400-kms-activator-and-timebomb-re) and extract it to a folder.
2. Run the KMS Activator.exe file as administrator.
3. Select Windows 8 Build 8400 from the drop-down menu and click Activate.
4. Wait for the activation process to complete. You should see a message saying "Activation successful".
5. Restart your computer to apply the changes.

Congratulations, you have activated your Windows 8 Build 8400. However, you still need to remove the timebomb to prevent it from expiring on January 15, 2013. To do that, follow the next method.
 
## Offline Method
 
The offline method involves modifying some files in the Windows installation image before installing it on your computer. This method does not require an internet connection or a product key, but it requires some technical skills and tools. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Download the Windows 8 Build 8400 ISO file from [here](https://www.betaarchive.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=25286) and mount it or burn it to a DVD.
2. Download the Timebomb Remover from [here](https://www.betaarchive.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=17898) and extract it to a folder.
3. Open the Timebomb Remover folder and copy the store and tokens folders.
4. Open the Windows 8 Build 8400 ISO file or DVD and navigate to the sources folder.
5. Open the install.wim file using a tool like 7-Zip or UltraISO.
6. Navigate to Windows\System32\spp folder inside the install.wim file.
7. Delete the store and tokens folders inside the spp folder.
